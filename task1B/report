Important! These are the requirements to run: numpy, pandas, sklearn
This submission uses sklearn's KFold to calculate the folds.
Hence sklearn as a python package is needed!
(As well as numpy for the other calculations and pandas for the data formating and working)

Report:
As we use colab for our development we load the training data from the github repo where we uploaded it (same repo as the jupyter notebook itself is saved to).
Then we split the 700 lines of training data into 7 splits as per kfold to try out our pipeline, where we saw that on most folds we are below the baseline.
This pipeline is nothing much, we just first calculate the feature transformations on the training data and then run a ridge regression on it.
(Where we use our the ridge regression we saw during one of the exercise sessions). The general idea for the feature transformation was taken from that same exercise session code,
but then reshaped to the necessary size for this problem.
We did try to change the read and written precision of the values to and from the csv, but that did not change much (actually higher precision gave a lower public score).
Before writing out the 21 weights to the file 'out.csv', is the execution of our get_coefficients with all of the training data we have.
